<h1>Goodbye Afternoon....</h1>

<p>Oh man, this was not good.  Wasted a large portion of the day.  That&#39;s
ok though, I will just have finish up tonight, since I am going to go
swimming in a little while.</p>

<p>But, for the first I am was coding in FIAL this morning -- I mean,
really coding in it.  You know, it was <em>flowing</em>.  I think getting rid
of the semicolons was huge, definitely worth the trade off.  Wrote a
function to determine if a point is inside a polygon -- it&#39;s a little
tough to judge the difficulty with regards to the language, because
this stuff just doesn&#39;t write itself no matter what.</p>

<p>And, once I get the polygon clipping working at all, I am going to
stick a fork in it, and put it up as a sample.  I can just document
what doesn&#39;t work perfectly -- it&#39;s meant as a FIAL sample, not a
textbook demonstration of polygon clipping.</p>

<h1>Lamda the Ultimate?</h1>

<p>I&#39;ve been toying with the idea of soliciting opinions from the website
<a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/">Lambda the Ultimate</a>, and I think I
like the idea of it, but I&#39;m not really sure that they would give me
anything useful.  I&#39;m not really stuck, I guess I would just like
something of a sanity check with this language, but I&#39;m a little
afraid that by posting there I will get a million comments that use
words I have to look up just in order to be positive that I don&#39;t
understand them.</p>

<p>I honestly don&#39;t know where else to go and ask about any of this stuff
from, and I would like an opinion or two before I start crystalizing
the internal data structures of the interpreter.</p>

<p>Well, I just checked over the website a bit.  I think the probable
result is that there will be at most a couple replies, which may or
not be either comprehensible or insightful.  They can&#39;t insult me,
since I have no idea what they are talking about.</p>

<h1>Ok, back from swimming, watching a movie tonight</h1>

<p>Well, shit.  </p>

<p>Back from swimming, and I&#39;m going to watch a movie.  So I met get a
little done in the late night, but not very much today.  Well, that&#39;s
ok, tomorrow is a new day.   </p>

<p>I want to push through the clip polygon, and probably go back and
rewrite the comic book viewer.  I need a basic menu system, and start
getting to work on using FIAL to create OpenGL rendering pipelines.</p>
