<h1>Ok, First Real Post</h1>

<p>This is the first real post of this here blog thing.  I was sick for a
little bit, but I am now all better.  Yet, I still haven&#39;t gotten much
done in the way of programming today.</p>

<p>Did fix up my the &quot;leave&quot; and &quot;redo&quot; statements in my FIAL language,
and honestly, I feel very impressed with myself overall.  Not for that
little bit of coding, of course, but just in general.  I mean, I guess
I knew I could create a language, it&#39;s just that seeing it now as
something unique, and simple, and powerful, it just makes me happy.
The joy of creation I suppose.</p>

<p>I think the next thing I am going to do is write a polygon clipping
algorithm, which will hopefully be a good example of FIAL programming.
In my experience, there is no good way to clip a polygon without
getting your hands dirty, and that&#39;s exactly the kind of thing FIAL
was meant to do well.  Then I will finish up the documentation, and
call it v0.0.1.  I will then maybe solicit opinions as to what I have
so far.</p>

<p>I think after that I am going to go directly into setting up a way to
create OpenGL rendering pipelines using FIAL.  The alternative is to
work on a basic gui system for an SDL/OpenGL app.</p>

<p>But exciting things are definitely on the way!</p>
