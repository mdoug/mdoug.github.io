Wow, it's been a while.  However, I have gotten some stuff done.  I have gotten
FIAL running in a multithreaded fashion, relatively flawlessly, using
golang-style channels.  I have a demo that shows that it is usable for dealing
with OpenGL rendering.  

I am at a little bit of a cross roads.  I have had ideas of making something
that moves text around, to make sure that code is working, but I think at this
point I am more interested in just pushing forward.  The question is, "what's
the next step."

Since I have rudimentary drawing, I think it is probably best to just get on
with it, maybe by creating a new project, and then getting physics up and
running.  I don't need much in the way of physics -- just the ball/block/circle
center stuff.

At some point I would like to add text abilities, but that is maybe not the most
pressing.  So, next I think next on my agenda is to start a new project, and
establish basic physics.  Then I can add in the graphics stuff, and write an
event loop for it.  

I would like to have a dev console sooner rather than later, however.   I don't
know how that will play out, though.  I am really ready to do this now!  I will
have a couple of things to maybe add to FIAL as I go along, but basically that
is done.  And it is AWESOME!  hehe.
