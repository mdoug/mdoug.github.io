Man, I still have a nasty headache.  Maybe it's because I'm trying vim out now,
and everything is a royal pain.  I really should just go back to Emacs, I don't
even know how to word wrap this thing.  Ok, word wrapped.  

Well, I don't know.  It's confusing, I guess I'll give it a couple weeks.  Emacs
had a nice file browser thing, I don't know that vim has anything like that, if
it does, I haven't found it yet.  Obviously, the main this is that Emacs just
kind of started to drag on me -- I just don't use any of those features, and I
still have to put up with a lot of its issues.  

I just want a basic text editor!  But at the same time I want highlighting for
all my languages, and quick editing.  So here we go, I will try vim.  I think I
should also try using a "new style" text editor also, one that uses SHIFT +
arrow keys for highlighting.  

All told I think this vim thing will not work out.  I am sure I have tried this
before, and that I didn't like it then.  But, maybe it is better now.  I really
don't know.  Sigh.  I just want something to use that I don't completely hate!

# Well, that sucked.

I just spent a million hours getting this blog post updated, because I
wrote it in vim, and something must have messed up with the line
endings not being recognized properly, causing the blog template to
not load right, causing it to be put in the wrong place without any
formating.  

So I went back to Emacs, and did a little cut and paste, and it worked
fine.  Now, I'm not saying this is caused by vim.  I'm sure people do
this sort fo thing with vim all the time, and they probably don't
understand how I could bugger this up.  Vim might have nothing to do
with it.  But the problem is that I don't think I will ever get any
appreciable benefit from using that over Emacs.  I will keep my eyes
out for some good tools in the future, but for now I am just going to
stick to what I know.

But, for the record, I would like to learn vi at least remedially, for
config files and stuff from the terminal, where it seems to fit in
better as being just another command line tool.
