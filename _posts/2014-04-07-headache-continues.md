title: Still Have Headache
categories:blog
----

Man, I still have a nasty headache.  Maybe it's because I'm trying vim out now,
and everything is a royal pain.  I really should just go back to Emacs, I don't
even know how to word wrap this thing.  Ok, word wrapped.  

Well, I don't know.  It's confusing, I guess I'll give it a couple weeks.  Emacs
had a nice file browser thing, I don't know that vim has anything like that, if
it does, I haven't found it yet.  Obviously, the main this is that Emacs just
kind of started to drag on me -- I just don't use any of those features, and I
still have to put up with a lot of its issues.  

I just want a basic text editor!  But at the same time I want highlighting for
all my languages, and quick editing.  So here we go, I will try vim.  I think I
should also try using a "new style" text editor also, one that uses SHIFT +
arrow keys for highlighting.  

All told I think this vim thing will not work out.  I am sure I have tried this
before, and that I didn't like it then.  But, maybe it is better now.  I really
don't know.  Sigh.  I just want something to use that I don't completely hate!
