Ok, retrying vim.  Not sure what I do when it explodes again....

# Ok, I actually have fairly big plans for the day:

Not necessarily in order:

1. Set up values so I can create an OpenGL rendering pipeline in FIAL.
2. Set up bindings to some boost::geometry stuff.  
3. Embed FIAL into Tcl -- this is going to be needed to create GUI apps, which will be needed for toolchains.  For instance, it does not seem considerably more difficult to create a debugger using FIAL and Tcl/Tk than it does to do it in a mode in emacs -- and the standalone version is much to be preferred.  Another alternative is to just write the apps in Tcl/Tk, which also seems preferable to tacking it onto another tool.  
4. Test out the basic framework in a multithreaded environment, probably using the OpenGL app from above.  
5. Get started with a vidya gaem.  

So, that should be a full day, or I guess maybe 2.  Or 3.  I don't know man, it's a lot of stuff, but I will try my best to power through it.  The good thing is that all of this stuff will be useful to me shortly, so I have that going for me.
